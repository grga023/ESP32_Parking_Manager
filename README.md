# Description  
Parking management system based on the ESP32 development board, featuring spot counting, automatic exit control, a web server interface, and additional functionalities.

# Use Case  
- When a user attempts to access the parking lot with a valid RFID card, the RFID software component verifies the card ID. Upon successful validation, the EntryRamp task is triggered, and a personalized greeting ("Hello [Name]") is displayed.  
- When a vehicle parks in a slot, the distance sensor detects occupancy, and the count of available parking spots is decremented by one. The display component updates to show the current number of free spots.
